# Python Practice Problems

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks devoted to addressing coding prompts in Python. They are mainly from [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).  Other notebooks may deal with understanding specific Python packages.

One time, I solved an [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents) prompt asking for the code needed to get text ready for a word cloud (a tokenized frequency dictionary) but I went beyond and plotted the words for a more complete answer!

I use Jupyter notebooks to solve problems in a more modular style. The experience above inspired me to further explore alternate approaches or reach my own goalposts for a prompt.

* Notebook [hr-statistics-normal-distribution.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/python_practice/blob/master/hr-statistics-normal-distribution.ipynb) looks at the HackerRank Normal Distributions I and II problems, and normal distributions more generally, with `scipy` and `random` packages. It reads in numbers from normdist1.txt and normdist2.txt and outputs them to normdist1-results.txt and normdist2-results.txt, for Normal Distributions I and II, respectively. It uses plots to visualize the distributions and touches on the standard normal distribution.
* Notebook [Logging-practice.ipynb](https://github.com/bronwencc/python_practice/blob/master/Logging-practice.ipynb) creates a log file named [this_is_a.log](https://github.com/bronwencc/python_practice/blob/master/this_is_a.log), gaining a better understanding of logging in Python.
